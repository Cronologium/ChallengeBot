        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description-text">
            Battleship is a board game for two players who try to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a
            10 Ã— 10 grid that can't be seen by his opponent. Players take turns calling out a row and column on the other
            player's grid in an attempt to name a square that contains an opponent's ship.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
            Before the game begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their grid. Each ship occupies a number
            of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each
            ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e. only one ship can occupy any given
            square in the grid) or exit the grid. The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
            After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player
            takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent
            announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. When all of the squares of a ship have been hit,
            the ship is sunk. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.

        <h4>Code description</h4>
        <p class="description-text">
            Your solution will not be run from a main function. Instead, each of the required functions will be called
            when needed. You will face off against an opponent while a server acts as the coach of the game. If you give
            the server a bad command or you exceed your time limit, the game is over for you.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
            You will implement a Solution class which deals with the above described rules. The server first will ask for
            position of all 10 ships, which will be through a string parameter in the function <b>put_ship</b> as
            follows: "<i>ship size x</i>", where x is the size of the ship, a number between 1 and 4. You will need to
            answer back in the function with 4 integers between 0 and 9 denoting crammed into a string.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
            After all 10 ships are positioned, the server will send to the <b>shoot</b> function as the string argument
            the answer of the last command as well as what did the opponent do the last turn. During your turn, you can
            mark what happened to your previous shot and try to shoot another. The actions are separated by the string
            " | ". The first action, if it is not the first turn, will always be "hit x y" "miss x y" which means you
            either missed or hit the shot on x y which occured during your last turn.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
            The game will automatically end when a player has no ships left. You do not need to be aware of this case.
        </p>
        <h4>Specifications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The time limit is applied to each individual function</li>
            <li>The memory limit is applied to the whole program</li>
            <li>Before challenging others, you program has to be validated</li>
