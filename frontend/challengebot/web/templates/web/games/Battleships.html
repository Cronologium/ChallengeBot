        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="description-text">
            Battleship is a board game for two players who try to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a
            10 Ã— 10 grid that can't be seen by their opponent. Players take turns calling out a row and column on the other
            player's grid in an attempt to name a square that contains an opponent's ship.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
            Before the game begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their grid. Each ship occupies a number
            of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each
            ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e. only one ship can occupy any given
            square in the grid) or exit the grid. The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
            After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player
            takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which they choose to shot. The opponent
            announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. If it is, the respective square of the ship is hit.
            Otherwise, the square is marked as missed. When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship sinks.
            If a player manages to sink all enemy ships, they win.

        <h3>Code description</h3>
        <p class="description-text">
            Your solution will take into consideration the two different stages of the game. During stage one, players
            put their ships on the battleships grid, one at a time, from smallest to largest. During stage two, players
            take turns in shooting each other attempting to sink enemy ships.
        </p>
        <h4>Return types</h4>
        <p class="description-text">
            You will implement a program which interacts through stdin/stdout. In the first phase of the game, you are
            provided through stdin with an integer, denoting the size of the ship required. You will return the 4
            coordinates of the ship (start x, start y, end x, end y) followed by and endline. If your language of choice
            does not automatically flush the output, you need to do it yourself. After all 5 ships are positioned, your
            solution will print coordinates to shoot and will recieve whether a ships was or not on that position.
        </p>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The time limit is applied to breaks between reads and writes</li>
            <li>The memory limit is applied to the whole program</li>
            <li>Before challenging others, your program must to be validated</li>
            <li>Your program will end automatically after a player wins</li>
        </ul>
